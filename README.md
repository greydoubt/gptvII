completely asinine zero effort high pay-off massive meteoric mother model (4M / Platonic-FORM) :

use this:
https://github.com/greydoubt/m77_prototype

grab a LOT of trash from the internet

then use DES (low-weight easy cracked cipher) :
https://github.com/greydoubt/DES-Full-Cipher
this crunches the data like a BIG HUGE GIANT DRAGON chomping rocks

Then run all this for superfluous structural spandrels:
https://github.com/greydoubt/COMPLEXITY_LAND

goal:
migrate as much to cuda as possible to just haul/crunch/crystallise/fracture to generate high entropy model

Based on the results found at: 
https://github.com/greydoubt/m77_prototype
The models will, regardless of fine tuning or "stunts" or preprocessing using human intuitions of cognitive models, just do its thing

Missing: Video / Image layer
